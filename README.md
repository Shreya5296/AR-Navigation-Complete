# AR Navigation

To test the complete navigation from source to destination with significant distance between the source and destination, host the application on GitHub. This is because ngrok is limited in range and you would need to move away from the system where the ngrok server is running, for navigation. To avoid this we can host this application on GitHub.

To test te output--
1. <Your github.io urlpath>/main.html
2. Enter source or tap/click on the map to get exact latitude and longitude.
3. Enter destination or tap/click on the map to get exact latitude and longitude.
4. Click on the â€œNavigate" button.
